Securecom Voice
===============

An application that provides encrypted voice calls for Android.

This project is based on Redphone from Open WhisperSystems.

Redphone is an application that enables encrypted voice communication between Redphone users. Redphone integrates with the system dialer to provide a frictionless call experience, but uses ZRTP to setup an encrypted VoIP channel for the actual call.  Redphone was designed specifically for mobile devices, using audio codecs and buffer algorithms tuned to the characteristics of mobile networks, and using push notifications to maximally preserve your device's battery life while still remaining responsive.

Securecom Voice has the following unqiue features:

1. The use of email addresses for identity is supported in addition to phone numbers
2. Devices without telephony, such as tablets, are supported
3. Blackberry devices are supported
4. Contact discovery is performed in the same way as Securecom Messaging
5. Securecom Voice has a dialpad
6. The favorites tab view is populated with registered contacts rather than standard dialer favorites
7. By default, Securecom Voice uses signalling and relay servers operated by Securecom
