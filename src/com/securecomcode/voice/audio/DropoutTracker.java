/**
 * When a network dropout occurs packet latency will increase quickly to a maximum latency before
 * quickly returning to a normal value.  These dropouts create local peaks in latency that we can
 * detect.
 *
 * DropoutTracker registers when packets with given sequence numbers arrive and
 * attempts to predict when additional packets should arrive based on this information.
 *
 * The predicted arrival times allow the estimation of an arrival  lateness value for each packet
 * The last several lateness values are tracked and local peaks in lateness are detected
 *
 * Peak latencies above a the "threshold of actionability" (300msec) are discarded since we never
 * want to buffer more than 300msec worth of audio packets.
 *
 * We track how many peaks occurred in several latency ranges (expressed as a packet count) and
 * provide the ability to answer the question:
 *
 * If we wanted to have only N buffer underflows in the past M seconds, how many packets would need
 * to be stored in the buffer?
